1. Everything that exists have an explanation of its existence. Either an external cause or or by its own nature.
2. The universe (all matter and energy) exists **contingently**
   - Everything in the universe exists contingently. That is, the configuration of matter and energy has some cause.
   - Contingency does not change under aggregation. There is not *less cause* of a forest versus a mote.
3. The cause of the universe existing must transcend matter and energy
4. The universe must have a cause beyond it
5. This cause must either be contingent or non-contingent
6. Infinite regress is impossible, therefore it must be non-contingent
7. This non-contingent cause is what we call God

# #1

This point should cover all logical possibilities. Namely:

1. Things have a cause, something that explains their existence outside of themselves.
2. Things don't have such an explanation, and therefore "just exist".

Whether we know that for any given thing is another question, but I'm quite certain that these two possibilities cover all possible causality.
As for those particles that pop in and out of existence, we would generally say "because of the way Quantum Mechanics works", once again, making it a case of 1 where we do have an explanation.
Why does Quantum Physics work that way?
An atheist would say "Because QM just is. Or because of Theory X", at which point, you've just made another name for God.
A theist would say. "At the bottom, because God made it that way."

# #2

Right, but what we generally call "the universe" isn't MERELY the particles, but the patterns that they make, be them stars, planets, people, everything else.
I'm having trouble following your argument, so I suggest that we taboo **emergent property** for the moment.

Are you asking:

1. For me to show that order does not inherently arise from particles existing?
2. That matter in the universe isn't eternal?
3. That the patterns are not created by some other eternal pattern?

# #7

Well, we first have to prove that G exists, then we can start describing its properties in detail.
Aquinas took several hundred pages to even go over this using logic, and we've already spent a few thousand words on mere existence. :-)

**Dean—** "Simultaneously fully aware of and in control of every particle or wave or anything else in the unvierse and outside it as well." That seems to get people's attention. There's been some intentional infusion in the culture I think, obsessing over "origins" and allow it to come to be believed that smart people think God built the universe and now just sort of watches it or these other daft ideas of God few have ever actually had.
**Chris—** Omnipotence and omniscience are trivial consequences of the proof from contingency and necessity.  Agency is also definitionally there since a noncontingent thing cannot have been forced to do anything by an external force.  Consciousness is harder, especially since it is by analogy. But do remember that atheists have not, in general, read the summa so they don't know that this is a beginning, but an endpoint.
