Faithful Skepticism

True skepticism leads to religious observance.

"Nothing is certain, not even this."

This is a self-defeating principle.
Like Samson in the temple, it knocks down all views and itself.

The Problem of Induction
########################
Empiricism means to learn through observation and experience.
This is related to the idea of induction, that is to move from individual cases to general cases.
There are a few issues with this.

The simplest example of this is called the new problem of induction.

The example is this, there are two colors, one called green and one called grue.

- Casaulity is suspect
- Calculative reason is suspect
- If calculative reason is suspect, using it as the gatekeeper of knoweledge is unreasonable
- Any gatekeeper of knowledge must be able to handle the limits of calculative reason
- The only such mechanism that does not require this is Faith
- Therefore Faith is the reasonable gatekeeper of all knowledge
