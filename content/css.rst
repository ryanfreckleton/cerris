:summary: I've decided to get better at CSS...
:status: published

So far, I've revamped this website's CSS and am doing a presentation at PySprings_.
I don't think that my skills are up to snuff, so this is a great way to get better at it.

I've used a modification of the jAnki_ method to do this.
Learning only enough to to finish this project and writing down the learnings.
After I'm done for the day, I look at the learnings and turn them into Anki cards.
It works well and makes learning a lot easier.
I end up creating simple models that I then build on top of.

I started this 2016-05-13, it's now 2016-06-07.
It took quite a bit longer than I had hoped!
And I'm not even done with either my CSS styling or the presentation yet.
