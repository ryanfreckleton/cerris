I've been using Python for 16 years as a hobbiest and approximately 10 as a
professional programmer.

Some of the libraries I'm familiar with are:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- nltk
- matplotlib
- mrjob
- Flask
- Django

And I am familiar with a variety of paradigms in the language, including
functional and object oriented programming and various techniques for
distributed computing, primarily scatter/gather.

Some of the large projects in Python I've worked on include:

- Automated system testing framework for large scale enterprise storage
- Ontology alignment
- Custom Django-based CMS

I also co-organize the PySprings user group, and taken the lead on:

- Python Beginner's Workshop
- Testing in Python
- Matplotlib Tutorial
