Title: Argument From Contingency
Date: 2016-10-18

I'm putting this conversation on this page so that we can look at it in one place.

This has a few errors, which I correct below:

1. Everything that exists have an explanation of its existence. Either an external cause or or by its own nature.
2. The universe (all matter and energy) exists **contingently**
   - Everything in the universe exists contingently. That is, the configuration of matter and energy has some cause.
   - Contingency does not change under aggregation. There is not *less cause* of a forest versus a mote.
3. The cause of the universe existing must transcend matter and energy
4. The universe must have a cause beyond it
5. This cause must either be contingent or non-contingent
6. Infinite regress is impossible, therefore it must be non-contingent
7. This non-contingent cause is what we call God

### #1

This point should cover all logical possibilities. Namely:

1. Things have a cause, something that explains their existence outside of themselves.
2. Things don't have such an explanation, and therefore "just exist".

Whether we know that for any given thing is another question, but I'm quite certain that these two possibilities cover all possible causality.
As for those particles that pop in and out of existence, we would generally say "because of the way Quantum Mechanics works", once again, making it a case of 1 where we do have an explanation.
Why does Quantum Physics work that way?
An atheist would say "Because QM just is. Or because of Theory X", at which point, you've just made another name for God.
A theist would say. "At the bottom, because God made it that way."

### #2

Right, but what we generally call "the universe" isn't MERELY the particles, but the patterns that they make, be them stars, planets, people, everything else.
I'm having trouble following your argument, so I suggest that we taboo **emergent property** for the moment.

Are you asking:

1. For me to show that order does not inherently arise from particles existing?
2. That matter in the universe isn't eternal?
3. That the patterns are not created by some other eternal pattern?

### #7

Well, we first have to prove that G exists, then we can start describing its properties in detail.
Aquinas took several hundred pages to even go over this using logic, and we've already spent a few thousand words on mere existence. :-)

The definition of God that I use is:
- Omnipotent
- The Grounding of Being
- The Supreme Being
- All-Wise
- All-Good
- Love itself
- The Logos

This proof is a starting point to further discussion.
Oftentimes atheists talk about about the need to show God exists before we can talk about him.
This proof, from contingency, does provide that **something** exists in our ontology that is eternal and non-contingent, from there we can talk about properties.

Once we are satisfied with showing that this **something** exists, we can go in deeper about its specific properties.
Off the cuff, omniscience, omnipotence and agency are trivial consequences of non-contingency and God being a necessary being.
Agency because since God has no cause, he is free, and agency means the ability to act unimpeded.
Since each moment is contingent, on a variety of factors, that means that these factors are eventually rooted in **something**.
This **something** is fundamentally involved in every moment of existence.
Therefore this **something** is omnipotent and omniscient, because of its fundamental involvement.

If **Theory X** does not explain the contingency and causality of all moments, then it is fundamentally *less powerful* than what I call God.

Consciousness is analogical.
The poetic way that I tried to show on twitter, in longer form, is this:
If trees gave fruit to musical instruments that played themselves, we would not say the property of making music existed only in those "fruit" but in the tree themselves.
Likewise, since we are created by God and have intelligence, intelligence does not merely exist in us, but in our source as well.

Particles themselves are contingent based on our understanding of physics.
They decay, they didn't always exist.
They would not exist without the bigbang.
Now, some would say that the universe itself is God, but I, and most other Christians find [the proof of divine simplicity](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/proof-of-divine-simplicity) compelling.

The reason I requested [rationalist taboo](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_taboo) is because I felt that we probably had a different understanding of what emergent is.
My perspective is that a property is emergent only for a particular observer.
It means that observer could or did not predict the appearance of that property.
Depending on the perspective observers take, a property may be emergent or predictable.
Emergence is a relationship between an observer and a phenomena, not the phenomena itself.

When someone says a property is emergent, they are quite literally saying *I did not predict this property*.
That does not mean that the property is fundamentally unpredictable or unexplainable.

If God exists, He is the cause of everything.  
A cause of everything exists.  
God has the properties of: Agency, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Consciousness from your prior post.  
The cause of everything that is pointed out by the argument from contingency has these properties.

Ergo, the cause of the universe is by necessity, what theists call God.
